2d. Write a HTML program, to explain the working of frames, such that page is to be divided into 3 parts on either direction. (Note: first frame image, second frame frame paragraph, third fixed).
Aim: Write a HTML program, to explain the working of frames, such that page is to be divided into 3 parts on either direction. (Note: first frame image, second frame frame paragraph, third fixed).
Description: This HTML program demonstrates the concept of frames by dividing the web page into three horizontal sections using the <frameset> tag. The main file (index.html) uses the rows attribute to split the page into three parts: 30%, 40%, and 30% of the screen height respectively. Each section loads a separate HTML file using the <frame> tag. The first frame (image.html) displays an image, the second frame (paragraph.html) contains a paragraph of text, and the third frame (fixed.html) shows a fixed message, such as a footer or copyright note.

Code:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
      <title>Frames Example-Vertical Split</title>
</head>
<frameset cols="33%,33%,34%">
<frame src="C:\Users\Bhargavi\Downloads\Snapchat-1582342343.jpg".html" name="imageFrame">
<frame src="paragraph.html" name="paraFrame">
<frame src=http://127.0.0.1:8080/apex/f?p=4550:11:2054506615522742::NO:::.html" name="linkFrame">
